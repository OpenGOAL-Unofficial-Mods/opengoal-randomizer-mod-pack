## Checkpoint Randomizer
Warps you to a random checkpoint in the game after every X collectables/deaths. For example, you can warp after every power cell, or warp every 25 orb/fly/eco pickups, etc.
- You can control what counts towards the warp counter:
  - Power Cells
  - Precursor Orbs
  - Scout Flies
  - Green/Blue/Red/Yellow eco
  - Eco vents
  - Deaths
- You can control the number of collectables/deaths before warping
  - There's also an on-screen counter you can hide/show
- You can control how a random checkpoint is selected:
  - randomly selected across all checkpoints
  - random level is selected first, then a random checkpoint within that level
